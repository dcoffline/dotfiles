# Eric's Dotfiles

XDG-compliant zsh + Oh My Zsh setup for Bazzite, macOS, and WSL.

- Starship prompt
- Yazi file manager with proper bat previews
- Common aliases/functions in `commonrc`
- Distrobox-aware container detection

Just clone to `~/.config/zsh` and add the 3-line `~/.zshrc` bootstrapper.
